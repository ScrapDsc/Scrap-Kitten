# Kitten Scrap

This project was developed to ease the collection of information on rare badges in a Discord server. By using user IDs, the project verifies the badges of each user and filters out only the rare ones. This enables administrators or interested users to quickly identify rare badges and learn more about their significance. Make the most of this feature to enhance your Discord experience for grabbing or other purposes ðŸš€!
